## The repository

This repository contains solutions for some problems of the [Project Euler.](https://projecteuler.net/archives). Each challenge has its own directory with implementation and a short README file containing the answer and a short explanation. In each directory there is a `main.py` file that calculates and prints the solution.

## Run tests

To run tests make sure you have the `behave` package installed. If not, it can be installed with `pip install behave`. To run the tests, you have to simply run `behave` on your terminal.
