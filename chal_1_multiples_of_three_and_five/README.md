## Explaining the algorithm

Solve this problem with bruteforce would not be a problem. Although, I simplified arithmethic progression's formulas to solve the problem in the best way I could. The simplifications handled the fact that the first element of the progression would be 0.

## The answer

After running `python main.py 1` in the root of the project, we can see that the answer is `233168`.
